This lab deals with our implementation of First Fit or Best Fit. Best Fit was the method I used for my implementation. Best Fit iterates through the free list and checks which is the smallest segment that is equal or larger than the requested size. The resize checks if the segment to it is free and taking that space away from it wasn't going to make it under the minimum size.

To compile, simple type "make".
